# Brag Doc

I have found that continously maintaining a [Brag Doc](https://jvns.ca/blog/brag-documents/) is an effective way for:

1. documenting your achievements through out the year
2. capturing milestones for personal goals
3. recognizing the work you have done (or have been doing) 

While the method of documenting varies, I would recommend having an open brag doc that you and your supervisor can continually collaborate upon. 

If you have an amazing team (like I have had), I would furthur suggest sharing it with your peers and helping each other identify braggable points, that they themselves may have missed.

I cannot articulate the framework for a brag doc any better than the author herself, but here's a short gist of how I have been going about it. 

# My self-eval doc
I think when we write self-evaluation at the end of the year, I tend to focus on the "work I did" and not necessarily on the "work / problems / bugs / issues I identified".

Hence I use the following template, where I break down my brag doc like :

Work I directly did
Work I helped do
Work I brainstormed on and potentially influenced
Work I identified for others to do 

And literally any little thing I think I have done that fits in the above criteria gets added to my doc. 

That way, when time comes to submit my self-eval I don't have to rack my brains and sell myself short :)
