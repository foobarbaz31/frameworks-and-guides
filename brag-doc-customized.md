# Brag Doc

I have found that continously maintaining a [Brag Doc](https://jvns.ca/blog/brag-documents/) is an effective way for:

1. documenting your achievements through out the year
2. capturing milestones for personal goals
3. recognizing the work you have done (or have been doing) 

While the method of documenting varies, I would recommend having an open brag doc that you and your supervisor can continually collaborate upon. 

If you have an amazing team (like I have had), I would furthur suggest sharing it with your peers and helping each other identify braggable points, that they themselves may have missed.

I cannot articulate the framework for a brag doc any better than the author herself, but here's a short gist of how I have been going about it. 

# My self-eval doc
I think when we write self-evaluation at the end of the year, I tend to focus on the "work I did" and not necessarily on the "work / problems / bugs / issues I identified".

Hence I use the following template, where I break down my brag doc like :

## Work I directly did

Eg: projects, epics, tickets, features, bugs, tech scope, system design - I actually led / did / implemented

## Work I helped do
Eg: scenarios where I was a co-pilot as in someone else led the project but I implemented some tickets under the project or performed code pairs, bug bashes, etc

## Work I brainstormed on and potentially influenced
Eg: arch review / system design review meetings I attended and made valuable comments; meetings I attended and made contributions that influenced requiremetns or implementations, etc (even though I was not necessarily incharge of the project)

## Work I identified for others to do
Eg: any bugs I found and created bug tickets for ;) 


# Conclusion 

And literally any little thing I think I have done that fits in the above criteria gets added to my doc. 

That way, when time comes to submit my self-eval I don't have to rack my brains and sell myself short :) 

Hope this helps !
