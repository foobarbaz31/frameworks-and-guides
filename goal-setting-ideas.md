# What is Goal Setting ?
Everyone who has worked in a company with > 50 employees has undergone the process of yearly goal setting. Goals are set; against which your performance is measured and based on that your promotion / bonuses, etc get decided.

Various blogs speak about effective strategies for goal setting, with [S.M.A.R.T Goals](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/productivity/how-to-write-smart-goals) being industry favorite.

But personally I have often struggled with thinking of creative goals that would accelerate my career. After considerable experience, I built this list for myself and I hope it helps everyone.


# Team / Organization Goals
Before jumping down personal goals (that definitely enable you to stand out), ensure that your team and organizational goals are correctly set. 

Ensure you speak with your supervisors and peers for any clarification. 

# Personal Goal Ideas

The following is a list of ideas / inspirations for creating your personal goals. 

Achieving personal goals not only accelerates your career, but it is incredibly personally, rewarding !

## Customer Pain Points

If you are looking for inspirations around ideas, always go check out the customer pain points. In your company, this may be available to you via customer care Slack channels or JIRA boards or speaking with technical sales people.

More often than not, customer pain points are not huge problems (and hence generally don't become huge projects but remain KTLOs); but if tackled can significantly make the user experience easy. 

If you are able to address atleast one small customer pain point as your personal goal, you have already provided tons of value to the customer and thus your company. 

## Open Source Projects

All of us use open source libraries in our projects. But only on a few occassions do we have the time to contribute back to the community. 

Look for libraries / projects you often use and see if the maintainers need any help. Contribute by making PRs for issues you can help with. 

This is not only a wonderful personal goal that helps you stand out in your own company; but also helps you build your personal brand as an engineer.

## Speaking at Conferences

[Developer Adovacate](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-the-heck-is-a-developer-advocate-87ab4faccfc4/) is new career track that most tech companies are embracing.

Developer Advocacy is a challenging role that not only requires you to do you day-to-day job but also speak at conferences, write blogs posts, evangelize the work your team and company does.

If you organization, does not have a formal role for a developer advocate - this is an excellent goal to purse. 

Not only does it empower you and gives you confidence, it helps you build your network and community.

## Discovering new technologies and introducing in your own company

Needless to say, the world of software engineering changes everyday. 

As such there are always new technologies / packages that come up to solve existing technical problems (react and it's eventual evolutions are classic examples).

Follow repos such as [awesome-nodejs](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome-nodejs) or [hackernews](https://news.ycombinator.com/) to keep an eye out for new and upcoming technologies.

If something seems to solve a problem your company / team is currently facing, building a POC itself to evaluate the new tech can be an excellent personal goal.


## Data analysis and observability

This is by far my favorite excercise to find ideas for personal goals. It satiates the "researcher" in me :) 

Go log-digging and try to see if there is a pattern.

For eg, do you see a large number of 5xx that could really be 4xx ? do you see non-standardized data logging that you can correct ? do you see ways with which you can improve the observability of your systems ?

This method helps discover hidden customer pain points, sub-optimal system design issues, non-standard design pattern. 

Fixing these issues, not makes your teams' developer experience easy, but sometimes also ends up saving a lot of money for the company.

# Conclusion
Hope this helps !
